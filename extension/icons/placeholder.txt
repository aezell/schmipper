# Icon Placeholder

This directory should contain:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels) 
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

For now, these are referenced in manifest.json but not required for basic functionality.
The extension will work without icons, though browsers may show a default icon.
