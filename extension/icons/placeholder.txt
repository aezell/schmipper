# Icon Placeholder

This directory is for future icon files:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels) 
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

Icons have been removed from manifest.json for now.
The extension will work with default browser icons (gray puzzle piece).

To add custom icons later:
1. Add PNG files to this directory
2. Update manifest.json to include the icons section
3. Rebuild the extension
